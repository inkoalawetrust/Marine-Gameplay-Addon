# Marine Gameplay Addon

A simple addon for the [Smart Marines](https://github.com/inkoalawetrust/Smart-Marines). Adds features that would be expected out of a gameplay mod, mainly monster and item replacements. Along with a lot of settings for customizing marine behavior.

# Main features
- Settings for setting individual changes of specific monsters to be replaced by marines. i.e an 8/255 chance of a marine replacing a Zombieman, and a 127/255 chance of replacing a Hell Baron
- Ditto, but for replacing certain vanilla powerups with a beacon (See below)
- A beacon item that can be used to teleport in friendly marines to assist you.
- The ability to make friendly marines following you (Or even other actors) teleport back to you offscreen. Similar to what follower mods do when their NPCs get too far or out of sight of the player.
- Settings for changing the difficulty of marines (Through an override, or based on the map skill level) by (Mainly) changing what actual abilities they can use. As opposed to cheap difficulty settings like "Does 200% more damage".
- And more.

## Note
This addon needs AT LEAST [version 1.0.2 of the marines](https://github.com/inkoalawetrust/Smart-Marines/releases/tag/New-1.0.2) to work!
